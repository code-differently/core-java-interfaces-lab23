## Part 1 Coding Challenge

You have 30 mins to get as far in this challenge as possible. This is not about finishing, its about taking the correct steps to get to the end.

### Steps:

1. Comments, make sure you comment out every step you want to take, make a plan.
2. Start coding

### Problem
If you think of the basic numbers 0-20, you will notice that 13-19 contain the word "teen" in them.
The math instructor provides you with 3 numbers, you need to decided if 1 or more of them contain teen.

Return true if 1 or more of them contain teen.

Example:

containTeen(13, 20, 10) --> true

containTeen(20, 19, 10) --> true

containTeen(20, 10, 13) --> true

### Submission

Commit and push your solution to GitHub

## Part 3 - Homework

### Coding Challenge
For this special case, were going to say that during a game of basketball a "triple" is when someone scores the same
point value 3 times in a row. Such as, scoring 2 points three times in a row.
We are keeping track of players point values in an array, but we don't want you to accept any player who has "triples".

Evaluate the given array and return true if the array does not contain any triples.

Example:
```
dontAcceptTriples([1, 1, 2, 2, 1]) --> true
dontAcceptTriples([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]) --> false
dontAcceptTriples([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]) --> false
```
